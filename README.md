# The Sparks Foundation -Graduation Rotational Internship Program

This repository is dedicated to the completion of all my tasks with videos from The Sparks Foundation (Graduate Rotational Internship Program).
As of now, I will be updating the tasks from my domain : Data Science and Business Analytics for the October 2021 batch.

## Tools/IDE : Python/Jupyter Notebook

## Technical : Task 1 - Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)
### Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours. 
This is supposed to be done with linear regression as we will be using just 2 variables. </br>
<li>Dataset for this model can be found at : http://bit.ly/w-data.</br>
<li>Code for this model can be found at : <a href = "https://github.com/Nikhil-Sahu106/The-Spark-foundation-Internship.git">Task 1 Prediction using Supervised ML </a>.</br>


### What are we supposed to do with the given dataset?
We need to predict the score of the student if he/she studies for 9.25 hrs/day.

## Technical : Task 2 - Prediction using Unsupervised ML (Level - Beginner)
### Predict the optimum number of clusters, from the given "iris" dataset and represent it visually.
I will be implementing this with the help of K-Means Clustering algorithm. </br>
<li>Dataset for this model can be found at : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox.</br>
<li>Code for this model can be found at : <a href = "https://github.com/Nikhil-Sahu106/The-Spark-foundation-Internship.git">Task_2_Code</a>.</br>

### What are we supposed to do with the given dataset?
We need to predict the optimum number of clusters and it's visualization.
